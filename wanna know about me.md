ayo! i am @shavikausta 
i am a bit new to coding here is my experience uptill now -
  _i have a year worth of experience with python and i am still learning it .
  _i learned a bit of C while working with arduino .
i am doing my bachelors in mechatronics, automation and robotics engineering .
i love to make projects using arduino .
i am still in the processes of learning especially coding so i would really appreciate the help.
some other stuff about me is that-
    _i love going hiking , i play guitar too.
    _i have a introvert persona .
what i expect is to be able to make any project i think of and learning to code is also necessary for that.
